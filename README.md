# K-map

This is a program of solving Karnaugh Map(K-Map). This is a method of simplifying Boolean expressions. Here I have written code to solve or 2,3 and 4 variables but in real life problems circuits would have thousands of variables.

If you are a beginner you can learn more about Kmaps on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-k-map-karnaugh-map/)

If you want to go in depth the following two books are great
1. [Digital Design by Morris Mano](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Digital_Design.html?id=E6UeAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y)
2. [Digital Design principle and Practice by John F. Wakerly](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ulWcq_yv0WkC&source=gbs_book_other_versions)


PS Don't use this code to solve assignments quickly instead use to check answers, solving by hand will make your fundamentals strong :)
